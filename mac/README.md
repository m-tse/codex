# MacOS Codex Stuff

`color_scheme.terminal` - a nice looking color scheme for the default macOS terminal. Any changes get converted into really gross hex, so it's non-ideal
`colors.itermcolors` - XML of a copy of the terminal color scheme. Weirdly, iterm colors look different despite being the same RGB values, so I had to tweak some of them.
`iterm2.json` - iterm config in json format, a superset of `colors.itermcolors`. I'm not sure if I like the default terminal or iterm2 better. Right now the only feature of iterm that I like over default is the json style config. Otherwise I prefer the native version, with the beautiful `SF Mono` font, and I don't have to deal with installing another thing.
`DefaultKeyBinding.dict` - follow instructions in `configure.sh`
`configure.sh` - a bunch of shell commands to tweak macOS.
