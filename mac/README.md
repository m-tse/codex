# MacOS Codex Stuff

`color_scheme.terminal` - LEGACY since I use iterm2, a nice looking color scheme for the default macOS terminal. Any changes get converted into really gross hex, so it's non-ideal.
`iterm2.json` - iterm config in json format. iterm is something else to install, which is annoying, but it offers a few killer features that make it worth it.
  - native tmux integration. There's no other way to get copy/paste/scrolling/selection working
  - paste history
  - json style config that can be source controlled
`DefaultKeyBinding.dict` - follow instructions in `configure.sh`
`configure.sh` - a bunch of shell commands to tweak macOS.
