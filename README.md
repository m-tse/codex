Codex
=====
A place to store all my configuration settings to be productive across environments, Windows, Linux,
and MacOS. Feel free to use any of this if you find it useful!

ZSH Shell Instructions
----------------------

This is supposed to be composable with the pieces you want. To setup a basic posix environment, do the following:
```
cd codex
cp posix/submodules/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh ~/.zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
cp posix/submodules/zsh-history-substring-search/zsh-history-substring-search.zsh ~/.zsh-history-substring-search.zsh
cp posix/submodules/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh ~/.zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
cp posix/submodules/diff-so-fancy/diff-so-fancy ~/.diff-so-fancy
cp posix/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
cp posix/.profile ~/.profile
cp posix/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
